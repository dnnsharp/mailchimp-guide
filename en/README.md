MailChimp Integration

This extension provides the ability to subscribe to a [MailChimp](www.mailchimp.com/) list. Typically, this is a *Subscribe to Newsletter* form (already provided as a template in Action Form). But you have the ability to use this integration as part of any form or module. You can use it with Action Form, Action Grid, DNN API Endpoint, Sharp Scheduler and InfoBox.
