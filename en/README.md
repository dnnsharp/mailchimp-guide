Mailchimp Integration
=======


This extension provides the ability to subscribe to a MailChimp list. Typically, this is a Subscribe to Newsletter form (provided as a template in Action Form), but you have the ability to use this integration as part of any form - for example as part of registration. Additionally, you can also use it with Action Grid, DNN API Endpoint, Sharp Scheduler, and InfoBox.
