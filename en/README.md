Mailchimp Integration
=======


This extension provides the ability to subscribe to a MailChimp list. Typically, this is a Subscribe to Newsletter form (provided as a template in Action Form), but you have the ability to use this integration as part of any form - for example as part of registration. Additionally, you can also use it with Action Grid, DNN API Endpoint, Sharp Scheduler, and InfoBox.

The minimum requirements for these modules to work together are as follows:

* [Action Form 03.08.16](http://www.dnnsharp.com/products/download?p=AFORM&v=03.08.16)
* [Action Grid 03.00.05](http://www.dnnsharp.com/products/download?p=AGRID&v=03.00.05)
* [DNN API Endpoint 01.02.02](http://www.dnnsharp.com/products/download?p=DNNAPIS&v=01.02.02)
* [Sharp Scheduler 02.00.51](http://www.dnnsharp.com/products/download?p=SCHD&v=02.00.51)
* [InfoBox 01.00.09](http://www.dnnsharp.com/products/download?p=INFOB&v=01.00.09)
